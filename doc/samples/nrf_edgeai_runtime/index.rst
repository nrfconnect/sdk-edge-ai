nRF Edge AI Runtime samples overview
####################################

This page provides an overview of the samples, that show how to use the |EAI| on runtime with models generated by `Nordic Edge AI Lab`_.

   :depth: 2

The following samples demonstrate typical workflows for deploying models generated by `Nordic Edge AI Lab`_ to devices using the :ref:`nrf_edgeai_lib`:

* ``samples/nrf_edgeai/regression`` - Shows how to run a regression model (numeric prediction).
* ``samples/nrf_edgeai/classification`` - Shows multi-class classification and result handling.
* ``samples/nrf_edgeai/anomaly`` - Shows anomaly-detection workflows and thresholding.

Each sample includes a set of generated model sources located in :file:`src/nrf_edgeai_generated`, or guidelines on how to add them.
