Welcome to the Axon |EI| quick start guide!
This guide helps you combine the best of both worlds: the powerful hardware acceleration of the Axon NPU with the intuitive machine learning platform of |EI|.

If you're already familiar with |EI| and want to leverage the performance benefits of the Axon NPU, or if you prefer using the |EI| SDK over |EAILib| or direct Axon driver usage, you're in the right place.
This integration allows you to train models with |EI|'s user-friendly tools while taking advantage of the Axon NPU's dedicated hardware acceleration for significantly faster inference times.

By the end of this guide, you'll have an |EI| model running at peak performance on Axon-enabled Nordic devices!
