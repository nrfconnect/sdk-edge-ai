The following guide explains how to run Edge Impulse models on Nordic devices using Axon NPU hardware acceleration.
It is ideal if you want to use the Edge Impulse SDK while targeting the Axon NPU for inference execution.

To follow this guide, you should be familiar with the Edge Impulse development workflow and embedded application development.
Compared to using |EAILib| or working directly with the Axon driver API, this approach relies on the Edge Impulse SDK for model integration while still enabling NPU‑accelerated inference on supported devices.

After completing this guide, you will have deployed an Edge Impulse model that runs on the Axon NPU using the Edge Impulse SDK.
