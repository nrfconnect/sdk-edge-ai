This sample can be found under :file:`samples/nrf_edgeai`.

.. note::
   Before you flash your NRF Edge AI sample, make sure you have completed the
   following:

   * You have set up the nRF Connect SDK workspace as described in the main
     documentation :ref:`setting_up_sdk` page.
   * You have installed the required toolchain (Zephyr SDK) and `west`.

To build the sample, use a command similar to the following (adjust the board):

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b <board> samples/nrf_edgeai/<sample>

If the model sources are provided as a generated C library, ensure they are
placed under the application source tree (for example
``samples/nrf_edgeai/<sample>/src/nrf_edgeai_generated``) so CMake discovers
and builds them together with the application.
