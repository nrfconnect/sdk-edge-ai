* ``CONFIG_EDGEAI`` -- Enables the Nordic Edge AI Lab wrapper (nrf_edgeai) and its
  components in the build system.

* ``CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC`` -- When enabled, uses the Newlib C library. NRF Edge AI
  models and runtime may require a fuller libc implementation; the samples
  in this repository enable Newlib when required.

* ``CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_PRINTF`` -- Enable floating-point support for
  printf in Newlib when the model output or logging relies on floating point.

* ``CONFIG_FPU`` -- If the target hardware has an FPU, enabling the FPU will
  speed up floating-point inference operations.

Notes
-----

* The exact symbol names may differ between releases. Check the library
  Kconfig (`lib/nrf_edgeai/Kconfig`) for the most accurate and up-to-date
  option names.
* Some symbols are provided by the sample `prj.conf` files to guarantee a
  reproducible build configuration for the reference samples.
