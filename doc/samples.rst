The |EAI| repository provides several samples showcasing its functionality.
You can build the samples for a variety of board targets and configure them for different usage scenarios.

In the |EAI| repository, all samples are placed in the :file:`samples` directory.

The samples demonstrate typical workflows using the nRF Edge AI components such as digital signal processing (DSP) primitives, neural network engines, and runtime for the models generated by `Nordic Edge AI Lab`_.

* Runtime - Demonstrates using the nRF Edge AI runtime to initialize a model and run inference with a `Nordic Edge AI Lab`_ generated model.
* DSP - Demonstrates using the nRF Edge AI Digital Signal Processing (DSP) primitives for signal processing.
* NN - Demonstrates using the nRF Edge AI Neural Network (NN) engine for running its standalone models.

There are also additional samples demonstrating the integration of `Edge Impulse`_ with |EAI|:

* |EI|: Data forwarder - Demonstrates using `Edge Impulse's data forwarder`_.
* |EI|: Hello Edge Impulse - Demonstrates deployment of models in |EI| and usage of the inference engine provided by |EI| SDK.
